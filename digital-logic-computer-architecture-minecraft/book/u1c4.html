      <h1>Mods</h1>
      <p>This section details the mods added to the course as well as how to use them.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Most of the mods we had you install were quality-of-life or performance-enhancing mods. However, two of them, 
        <strong>Carpet mod</strong> and <strong>WorldEdit</strong>, will be quite useful for your projects.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Carpet</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Carpet mod</strong> essentially allows you to take complete control over how your game runs. Some useful commands are the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>/carpet setDefault creativeNoClip true</code>: Allows you to fly through blocks, which is <em>SUPER</em> useful for building large, complex redstone circuits. 
          I would enter this command immediately upon creating a new world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/tick rate [number]</code>: Allows you to change the tick rate/speed at which your game runs. Useful for testing circuits that take a while to run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/tick freeze</code> and <code>/tick step [number]</code>: Useful for debugging your redstone circuits 
          (yes, we even have a debugger in <em>Minecraft</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>/carpet creativeFlySpeed [number]</code>: Allows you to adjust your creative flight speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>WorldEdit</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>WorldEdit</strong> allows you to build a LOT faster and saves a lot of pain (from experience). Some useful commands are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>//wand</code>: Gives you a wand for area selection with left and right click.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//copy</code>: Copies the selected area, relative to your position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//paste</code>: Pastes whatever is in your clipboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//set [block]</code>: Fills the selected area with the specified block. If <code>[block]</code> is air, it removes all blocks in the area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//stack [direction] [number]</code>: Stacks the selected area relative to the direction you are facing. 
          <code>[direction]</code> can be <em>up, down, back, left, right, forward</em> for as many <code>[number]</code> times as you want. 
          This is <em>SUPER</em> usefulâ€”I absolutely crutch this command!
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//undo</code> and <code>//redo</code>: Self-explanatory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//flip</code>: Flips your clipboard based on the direction you are facing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//rotate</code>: Rotates the content of your clipboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//schem save [name]</code>: Saves a copied region as a schema file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>//schem load [name]</code>: Loads a build you previously saved into a world.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        I would get super familiar with using these commands, as they might be useful to you in your projects! :)
