        <h1>Subtractors</h1>
        <p>
            Before you read this section, make sure you are comfortable with adders. Subtraction, after all, 
            can be modeled as addition. Observe that, 5 - 2 is equivalent to 5 + (-2).
        </p>
        <h3>How Do We Represent Negative Numbers?</h3>
        <p>
            We would need an extra bit of information to convey parity. So, 0 for positive and 1 for negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok great, now what? Say we use three bits of information and one leading bit for parity: 
            <code>0101</code> is 5 and <code>1010</code> represents -2. Using a regular adder would yield 
            <code>1111</code>. Hm, not quite right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Observe that although -2 represented as <code>1010</code> does not yield the right result, adding 
            16 to this representation (so adding 14 instead) does, and this produces an overflow carry we disregard:
        </p>
        <pre>
                                    0101
                                    1110
                                    ----
                                   10011
        </pre>
        <p>
            The two values are synonymous due to modular arithmetic, where we take <code>2^(number of bits) - (value)</code> 
            to be added instead. So for -2, this could be 14, 30, 46,â€¦, etc., but we choose 14 since we can only represent 
            that given our number of bits.
        </p>
        <p><code>16 = 2 (mod 14)</code></p>
        <p>
            Think about modular arithmetic like a clock; -2 can be thought of as -2 o'clock or 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock is 
            more useful for us. This is called <strong>two's complement</strong>. We can flip all the bits and add 1 
            (<code>15 - X + 1</code>), which is equivalent to <code>(16 - X)</code> or the modulus. Note that this can be 
            extended to 5 bits (32) and so forth.
        </p>

        <p>
            So 2 is <code>0010</code>, but if we do <code>15 - 2</code>, (or observe that this operation flips all bits), 
            we get <code>1101</code>. If we add 1, we get <code>1110</code>, which is what we listed above. Going from a negative digit to a positive digit entails the same process.
        </p>

            In Minecraft, all you would need to do is negate your inputs and add one to an input.
